For all designs, I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc. unless absolutely necessary, or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Always split the code into tiny components or files, it makes it easier for you to work in it

NEVER SAY YOU "HELP ME" you do the fucking job that it, and you describe what you do
